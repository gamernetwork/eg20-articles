                                        Of all the games in the Xbox's European launch line-up, Halo is
                                        perhaps the nearest the console comes to having a killer app. It's
                                        the biggest-selling Xbox title to date in America, and the press on
                                        the other side of the pond have been raving about it for months.
                                        Now that it's finally arrived here in Europe, the question is, can
                                        it live up to the hype? And the answer is yes .. and no.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Halo puts you in the boots of a futuristic cyborg soldier known
                                        only as the Master Chief, and as the game begins you are being
                                        defrosted from cryogenic storage aboard a warship pursued by an
                                        alliance of alien religious fanatics called the Covenant. Luckily
                                        there's time for the engineers to power up your mobile armour suit
                                        and run you through some diagnostic tests first though, which gives
                                        you a chance to get to grips with the game's controls. Although I
                                        normally have difficulties with console shooters, Halo proved to be
                                        surprisingly easy to control, and the cinematic introductory
                                        sequences mean that you have several minutes to just run around
                                        admiring the scenery before having to actually shoot anything.

                                        Indeed, the opening sections of Halo come across as the bastard
                                        offspring of Unreal and Half-Life. Having completed your test run
                                        you must make your way to the bridge to talk to the captain,
                                        without the benefit of a weapon and getting only glimpses of the
                                        enemy as battles rage in side corridors and behind doors which are
                                        wedged half open. Even when you finally get hold of a weapon and
                                        join in the action for yourself, the atmosphere doesn't let up as
                                        you make a dash for the last remaining lifepod, fighting alongside
                                        scattered squads of human marines as Covenant boarders try to block
                                        your escape route.

                                        All of this pales into insignificance when you finally touch down
                                        on the mysterious ring which gives the game its title. With the
                                        surface of the vast orbiting Halo arcing into the sky above your
                                        head and grass-covered mountains towering all around you, the
                                        scenery is spectacular to say the least.

                                        <br>
                                        Not that you'll have long to stand gawping at the view, as the
                                        Covenant are soon joining you on the surface to search for
                                        survivors. Guided by the soothing voice of the ship's female AI,
                                        entrusted to your protection by the captain, you soon find yourself
                                        roped into tracking down the other lifepods that escaped your ship
                                        and helping the marines to fight off Covenant forces long enough
                                        for a dropship to arrive and evacuate them. We won't spoil the rest
                                        of the game for you, but suffice to say that there are plenty of
                                        plot twists and dramatic in-game cut-scenes to keep you amused over
                                        the course of Halo's 10 missions.

                                        The one downside to this heavily scripted story-led malarkey is
                                        that the game is depressingly linear at times, shuffling you from
                                        one encounter to the next and rarely giving you any real choice in
                                        where to go or what to do. While running around space ships and
                                        Halo's interior you will find an amazing wealth of locked doors
                                        which keep you from straying from the one true path, with
                                        occasional neon arrows conveniently painted on the floor to point
                                        you in the right direction in case there was any doubt. The outdoor
                                        settings look fairly open at first sight, but although there's more
                                        freedom of movement there are still only one or two paths open to
                                        you most of the time thanks to steep-sided canyons and the
                                        occasional rock fall.

                                        It's easy to forgive Halo these shortcomings for the first few
                                        hours though as it sucks you into a gorgeously rendered sci-fi
                                        world of bizarre aliens, curvaceous architecture and gaudy weapon
                                        effects. Halo is one of the most visually impressive games we've
                                        seen to date, and the only real problem on the eye candy front is
                                        an over-reliance on shiny metallic surfaces, giving it a slightly
                                        fake CG look in places.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The AI is equally strong, with the Covenant using cover and
                                        grenades to full effect, while groups of marines work together to
                                        cut them down, calling out directions as they track down
                                        stragglers. It's not perfect, and the enemy is a little passive at
                                        times, often allowing you to duck back behind cover and wait for
                                        your shields to recharge instead of pressing the attack. We were
                                        also a little alarmed at the frequency of friendly fire incidents
                                        in confined areas, although your men do at least apologise if they
                                        shoot one of their own. This constant chatter from both sides all
                                        adds to the atmosphere, and there's something undeniably satisfying
                                        about seeing a panicked Covenant grunt running away from you with
                                        his arms waving frantically in the air, shouting "he's unstoppable"
                                        and "they're everywhere".

                                        If you want to do some screaming of your own, Halo features a full
                                        co-operative mode, allowing you and a friend to fight your way
                                        through the campaign side by side. It's a rare luxury these days,
                                        but one which adds a lot to the game's replay value. Naturally the
                                        game also includes the usual deathmatch and capture the flag modes,
                                        as well as king of the hill, checkpoint races and "oddball", where
                                        you get points for holding on to a ball for as long as possible.
                                        Apart from co-op (which only works with two players) all of these
                                        modes support up to four players, either on one Xbox with a
                                        split-screen view or with multiple Xboxes networked together using
                                        the built-in ethernet adapter. Things can get a little choppy at
                                        times with more than one player sharing the same screen, but
                                        overall it works well. If you're feeling really adventurous, it's
                                        even possible to play over the internet by hooking your Xbox up to
                                        a PC running some (very unofficial) third-party software.

                                        Halo isn't without its faults though. For starters, those of us
                                        weened on PC shooters may find it a little frustrating that you can
                                        only carry two guns at a time. As the game uses a checkpoint-based
                                        autosave system, if you find you have the wrong weapon for the job
                                        your only choices are either to run back to wherever you dropped
                                        the gun you really need now, or to muddle through as best you can.

                                        <br>
                                        And while most of the game is spent fighting on foot, often alone
                                        behind enemy lines, the small selection of vehicles which you get
                                        to drive from time to time aren't quite as satisfying. A
                                        combination of slightly awkward controls, low gravity and
                                        incredibly soft suspension makes the buggy in particular a real pig
                                        to drive on uneven surfaces. Maybe I just need more practice, but
                                        the single-player game doesn't really offer much opportunity to get
                                        the hang of driving and flying the various vehicles, except when
                                        you're in a hurry to get somewhere and getting shot from all
                                        directions.

                                        Where Halo really falls down though is the pacing. The first few
                                        hours of the game is a work of unadulterated genius, constantly
                                        throwing new sights, enemies and weapons at you. But things go
                                        rapidly downhill from there on in. Suddenly you find yourself
                                        spending more time beneath the surface of Halo than above it, and
                                        most of these underground facilities are made up of a handful of
                                        drab prefab rooms repeated over and over again, with different
                                        combinations of monsters thrown in to block your way, and big
                                        glowing plot arrows in every room to point you through the one and
                                        only exit. Needless to say, clearing level after utterly linear
                                        level of near identical rooms soon gets tedious in some of these
                                        missions, especially when you find yourself forced to backtrack
                                        across a couple of miles of terrain that you've already explored at
                                        one point, with only a change of inhabitants to keep you
                                        interested. The game does at least pick up again at the end for an
                                        exciting finale, but by this point finishing the game may have
                                        become more of a chore than a delight for you.

                                        Halo is very much a game of two halves. The first half is fast,
                                        exciting, beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises.
                                        The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great
                                        cinematics but let down by repetitive, paint-by-numbers level
                                        design. Bungie could quite comfortably have cut several overly
                                        lengthy sections from this second half and still ended up with a
                                        respectably time-consuming game while maintaining the
                                        adrenaline-pumping pace of the first few hours. As it is Halo is a
                                        flawed masterpiece, one which is well worth owning but which may
                                        start to grate after a while.
