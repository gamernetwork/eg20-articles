            EuroLAN got off to a flying start in Brighton this weekend with a
            75 player LAN party, featuring Quake 3 CTF, duel, and two-on-two
            competitions, and live DJs to drown out the screams of the dying...
        </p>

</section><section class="">
  <p><center><b>Q3CTF</b></center></p>
  <figure style="float: left;">
    <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el03b.jpg/EG11/resize/180x-1/quality/75/format/jpg" data-uri="converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el03b.jpg" alt="el03b" class="preview"/>
  </figure>
  <p> The first of the Quake 3
                 competitions to be completed was the four-on-four CTF
                 tournament, with clan Eat Electric Death (including pro-gamer
                 Billox and our very own Mat "The Lurker" Bettinson)
                 predictably cruising through their first match.
        </p>

  <p>
            Team "0wn" had been formed at the event specially for the
            competition, and had never played together before. Some of them had
            never even played the tourney map, Q3CTF3, before. It was hardly
            surprising then that EED ran home with a comfortable 27 : 0 victory
            against them after just 20 minutes. Ouch.
        </p>

  <p>
            The final would be rather more challenging though, as although
            their opponents Team DM had also just been formed at the event, it
            included some of the top duellers from around the country, all of
            whom had taken part in the recent UK Razer-CPL qualifier. Kalliath
            had been knocked out in the third round and Dekkard in the quarter
            finals, Silent had made it to the finals of the losers bracket, and
            Blokey had been the event winner.
        </p>

  <p>
            Could EED triumph? Or could the high powered deathmatch collective
            take them down? The arena was Q3CTF3 - The Stronghold - and there
            were scores to be settled...
        </p>

</section><section class="">
  <p><center><b>Q3CTF Finals</b></center></p>
  <figure style="float: right;">
    <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el04b.jpg/EG11/resize/180x-1/quality/75/format/jpg" data-uri="converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el04b.jpg"  alt="el04b" class="preview"/>
  </figure>
  <p> DM got off to a
                 good start, picking up a few frags in the central area of the
                 level as they locked it down, while EED's Billox hung back to
                 defend their own base.
        </p>

  <p>
            EED's team experience soon paid dividends though, with Pod breaking
            through enemy lines to grab their flag. DM couldn't respond rapidly
            enough, and although EED's star defender Billox took a tumble into
            the mist, DM couldn't stop Pod from completing the capture.
        </p>

  <p>
            DM were fighting back hard though, and were particularly strong in
            the vital midfield. With Blokey's faultless rail aim backed up by
            support from his team-mates, EED's members were being cut down as
            soon as they entered the region. Eventually Pod broke through again
            though, and found DM's base completely abandoned! Seeing his
            opportunity he made a grab for the flag.
        </p>

  <p>
            Meanwhile the missing DM members had put in an appearance in EED's
            base and taken their flag. EED intercepted it though, and Billox
            (just) managed to return the flag after it was dropped, cut down by
            DM's gunfire just seconds after reaching it. Pod made it back to
            the EED base intact, and completed their second capture with just
            five minutes gone.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey made it into EED's base and made a grab for their flag after
            exchanging rails with the defenders. He didn't get far though, and
            the flag was soon back where it belonged. DM weren't to be put off
            though, and launched a massive co-ordinated attack on EED's base,
            sending Billox spiralling into the mist again as they grabbed the
            flag and scarpered.
        </p>

  <p>
            EED couldn't respond, and seemed to be caught off guard as DM
            picked up a second capture soon afterwards, taking the score to 2 :
            2 after nine minutes of play. DM almost made it three in a row, but
            this time a rocket launcher toting Billox chased down their flag
            carrier and then picked up another pair of frags in quick
            succession in the central arena before finally being killed.
        </p>

  <p>
            For the next five minutes there was a stalemate, with neither team
            able to reach their opponents' flag. Finally, with just five
            minutes left to play, a pair of DM players blasted their way into
            the EED base, took out Billox, and swiped the flag. It wasn't a
            clean get-away though, and EED struck back to prevent them
            capturing.
        </p>

  <p>
            Two minutes from the end it was still 2 : 2, and it looked as if
            the game might go into extra time. DM had other plans though, and
            EED's play seemed to be getting rather scrappy. A pair of DM
            players grabbed their flag and made off with it, and although EED
            managed to take out the flag carrier, the other attacker picked it
            up before EED could reach their fallen flag to return it.
        </p>

  <p>
            With just a minute to go the score was 3 : 2 to DM, and EED seemed
            to have lost the will to live. Despite goading from loud-mouthed
            Australian Lurker, EED couldn't put together a counter-attack in
            time to save the game.
        </p>

  <p>
            After being 2 : 0 down at half time, DM had come back to take the
            game 3 : 2 in an exciting climax. An impressive display.
        </p>

  <p>
                 Next up was the two-on-two team play competition. The quarter
                 finals had seen all the usual suspects getting through without
                 too much difficulty, with Blokey and Kalliath from UNR, Billox
                 and Pod from EED, and Silent and Dekkard all making it to the
                 semi-finals, as well as Strudles and Jekub.
        </p>

  <p>
            The big semi-final then was Kalliath and Blokey against Billox and
            Pod, with two of the top duellers in the country and two of the top
            clans in the country facing off on Q3DM6...
        </p>

</section><section class="">
  <p><center><b>Semi-Final</b></center></p>
  <figure style="float: right;">

  </figure>
  <p> Billox got off to a flying
                 start, catching an unarmed Blokey with his shotgun and then
                 picking up a second almost immediately as Blokey respawned
                 close by. Eventually Kalliath brought down the rampaging
                 Billox with a stream of plasma to take the score to 2 : 1.
                 Billox soon got his revenge, catching Kalliath in the quad
                 area, but before long he was down again.
        </p>

  <p>
            The two sides continued to match each other frag for frag, and
            after a frantic first minute the scores were 5 : 3 to Billox and
            Pod. Things were quiet for a couple of minutes after that as both
            teams became more wary, with each team picking up just two frags,
            taking it to 7 : 5 after three minutes of play.
        </p>

  <p>
            A couple of frags for Blokey levelled the scores, with Pod's
            remains being scattered far and wide by Blokey's rocket launcher.
            Billox managed to pull one back, but the scores were soon even
            again on 8 : 8.
        </p>

  <p>
            Billox caught Kalliath with his plasma gun in one of the top
            passages near the rocket launcher, and then dropped down from the
            bridge to grab some health near the top of the grand staircase.
            Just as he fell though Blokey appeared, and the top players almost
            collided as Billox dropped to the ground right in front of him.
            Blokey was momentarily taken by surprise, and Billox managed to
            rail him and grab the health.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey and Kalliath fought back to re-take the lead though, 10 : 9
            after five minutes. Their lead was soon extended, as Kalliath's
            rocket caught Billox by the double staircase, and Pod was having a
            hard time of it as well, with Blokey taking him down with a
            well-placed rocket in the quad room and then a second time. On
            respawning Pod managed to grab the quad, but couldn't make it
            count. After seven minutes the score was 18 : 12.
        </p>

  <p>
            Billox was fighting hard though. Spotting Kalliath heading up the
            stairs towards the rocket launcher, he rocket jumped up on to the
            bridge to head him off and caught him perfectly with a snap rocket
            shot as he emerged from the top of the stairs. Pod was getting into
            the action as well, hitting Blokey near the jump pad up to the
            railgun ledge. The shot didn't quite kill Blokey, but the fall to
            the ground did.
        </p>

  <p>
            After nine minutes of play Billox and Pod had come back to lead 19
            : 17, but Kalliath and Blokey weren't down yet, clawing back the
            deficit. As Blokey juggled Billox with his rocket launcher near the
            plasma gun the scores were dead even, 21 a piece.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey was on another rampage now, taking the lead as he caught Pod
            with his rail and then watched as he plumetted earthwards to
            crater. In the final seconds of the twelve minute game Blokey and
            Kalliath pulled out a small lead, and although Billox and Pod
            managed to pull two back the final score was 27 : 22.

  <p> The
                 last competition to be completed was the big Quake 3 duel
                 contest. Over thirty people had entered the event at the start
                 of the weekend, but by the semi-finals the l337 had been
                 seperated from the chaff, and Silent, Dekkard, Requiem and
                 Kajun were left standing.
        </p>

  <p>
            The semi-finals saw Dekkard and Silent battling it out in a close
            match that ended with Dekkard taking his slot in the final by just
            a single frag, while Requiem cruised to an 18 : 7 victory over
            Kajun. And so it was that Requiem and Dekkard came together to
            fight for first prize - an Athlon 800 processor, and the chance to
            face the UK's official representative at the forthcoming Razer-CPL
            tourney, Blokey...

  </figure>
  <p> The first match between Requiem and Dekkard took place on
            Q3Tourney2, every shaft lover's favourite duel map.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard grabbed the early lead, rocketing Requiem by the bridge
            within the first minute. Requiem managed to stay out of trouble for
            a minute, but their paths soon crossed again by the bridge.
            Dekkard's shaft found its target, while Requiem ran out of
            ammunition and had to whip out his gauntlet. He was already dead
            before he could get near Dekkard.
        </p>

  <p>
            On respawning though Requiem managed to grab a rocket launcher, and
            chased down Dekkard, killing him twice in quick succession in the
            top pillar room. The scores were even again, and both players
            managed to escape a rocket duel down by the lightning gun.
            Eventually Dekkard regained the lead though, shafting Requiem in
            the pillar room.
        </p>

  <p>
            Another rocket battle by the lightning gun left Dekkard on 15
            health, but again both players escaped intact. Before he could
            fully recover though he ran into Requiem in one of the corner rooms
            at the bottom of the map, and was blown to pieces to make the score
            3 : 3 at half time.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard wasn't impressed though, and came back with three quick
            rocket kills, starting his reign of terror at the bottom of the map
            and then following through in the pillar room. He was wounded now
            though, and on respawning Requiem chased him back through the
            teleporter to the bridge, and Dekkard took a dive into the red
            mist.
        </p>

  <p>
            He was soon back though, catching Requiem with his rocket launcher
            as he came back through the teleporter. Shortly thereafter mutual
            gibbage ensued, as Requiem and Dekkard blew each other up with
            their rocket launchers to get a frag a piece, making the score 9 :
            5.
        </p>

  <p>
            A rocket battle near the lightning gun ended in disaster for
            Requiem, as a glancing blow from Dekkard sent him flying into the
            red mist under the bridge. Shaken but not stirred, Requiem came
            back to shaft Dekkard and then caught him again with his machinegun
            as he respawned. With just a minute left the score was 9 : 6, and
            things got even closer as Requiem caught Dekkard with his rocket
            launcher near the bridge again.
        </p>

  <p>
            The final seconds saw Dekkard re-establish his lead though as
            Requiem desperately tried to make up his frag shortfall. A series
            of rocket kills took the final score to 12 : 7 for Dekkard.
        </p>

  <p>
            As it was best of three, Requiem would now have to beat Dekkard
            twice to win the competition...
        </p>

  </figure>
  <p> The second game was on Q3Tourney4. Requiem grabbed the plasma
            gun but couldn't find his mark at first, but Dekkard's rail aim was
            failing him as well. Switching to the rocket launcher, Requiem made
            his first kill, and soon followed it up with two rail frags in the
            first minute of the game.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard managed to pull back though, catching Requiem on the ledge
            outside with his shotgun, and then railing him in the central room.
            Both players raced for the megahealth as it respawned, and although
            Requiem got there first, Dekkard blew him up before he could grab
            it. And with a quarter of the game gone, Dekkard took the lead, his
            rail taking down Requiem round the side of the map to make it 4 :
            3.
        </p>

  <p>
            While Requiem was respawning and making a bee-line for the plasma
            gun, Dekkard got back to the top of the level and swiped the red
            armour, and after a short skirmish Dekkard's trusty rocket launcher
            triumphed. With almost half the game now gone, Dekkard picked up
            the next megahealth and railed Requiem twice in quick succession to
            extend his lead to 7 : 3.
        </p>

  <p>
            Requiem soon got one back, but Dekkard came at him with a shotgun
            to get his revenge. Picking up the railgun he caught Requiem again
            coming into the slime room, and then got a third frag with the
            rocket launcher. Requiem couldn't respond, and Dekkard continued to
            dominate the game, picking up three more frags to make the score 13
            : 3 after seven minutes.
        </p>

  <p>
            A nice long range rail shot earned Dekkard another frag, but
            Requiem managed to get one back, and was soon gunning for more as
            his rocket launcher took Dekkard down. But with less than two
            minutes left it was now 15 : 5, and too late for Requiem to
            recover.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard took it further out of his hands, catching him in mid-air
            with a shotgun blast after his railgun failed him, and then getting
            another kill with his rocket launcher. Requiem managed to pull back
            another, but Dekkard held the lead and ended the game 19 : 6 up.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard took home a shiny new 800MHz Athlon processor and
            motherboard, and Requiem got the runners-up prize of a Sirocco
            Crossfire speaker set from Videologic.
        </p>

  <p><center><b>Blokey vs Dekkard</b></center></p>
  <figure style="float: right;">
    <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el07b.jpg/EG11/resize/180x-1/quality/75/format/jpg" data-uri="converted/pics/articles/eurolan/el07b.jpg"  alt="el07b" class="preview"/>
  </figure>
  <p> As the party wound down, there was just one match left to
            play. Quake 3 duel winner Dekkard would take on the all-conquering
            Blokey on Q3Tourney2.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey had picked up an early 4 : 0 lead in the first ninety
            seconds of the game, and made it five with a shaft kill in one of
            the corner rooms. He almost got a sixth, but Dekkard managed to
            escape him with just 7 health left! He managed to grab a 25 health
            power-up, but Blokey ran into him again soon afterwards and a
            single well-placed rocket finished him off.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey's shaft caught him again in a corner room to make it seven,
            his eight came in the pillar room, and with three minutes gone the
            score went to 9 : 0. It was obvious that Blokey was in dominant
            form, and after a running rocket and shaft skirmish in the pillar
            room, Blokey had taken it to 11 : 0 at half time.
        </p>

  <p>
            As Blokey picked up another frag Dekkard suddenly realised he had
            his headphones on back to front, and took advantage of the respawn
            delay to correct his audio. Sadly it didn't help him much though,
            as Blokey got several more frags in quick succession to take the
            score to 16 : 0 with four minutes to go.
        </p>

  <p>
            Dekkard was fighting to regain some dignity now, and finally
            managed to pick up his first frag of the match eight minnutes in,
            shafting Blokey in the pillar room. Blokey took him down with a
            shotgun to make it 20 : 1, but Dekkard managed to grab a rocket
            launcher and came back at him. His enthusiasm got the better of him
            though, as his rocket blew up both Blokey and himself. Nil points.
        </p>

  <p>
            Then disaster struck for Dekkard as Blokey's rocket blast knocked
            him into the red mist, wiping out his sole frag to make it 20 : 0
            with just a minute left to play. Down but not out, Dekkard managed
            to pull a couple back in the dying seconds of the game, rocketing
            Blokey in the pillar room and then taking him down with his
            machinegun soon afterwards.
        </p>

  <p>
            Blokey apparently wasn't impressed though, whipping out his
            gauntlet to finish Dekkard off after respawning. "Humiliation!" The
            final score was 23 : 2, after an impressive demonstration of just
            why Blokey is going to be the UK's official representative at the
            Razer-CPL.

  <p> The first
                 EuroLAN went remarkably smoothly, with no major problems. The
                 network took a little longer to get running than we had
                 expected, but by the time I arrived on Saturday lunchtime
                 everything was working fine.
        </p>

  <p>
            Amazingly there wasn't a single network out-age or power cut during
            the entire weekend, which has to be a first for a major LAN party.
            Certainly this is the first "bring your own PC" LAN party I've been
            to where nothing broke, and it's a credit to the admins that
            everything went so well.
        </p>

  <p>
            Sadly some of the extra-curricular activities we had hoped to run
            during the weekend didn't happen in the end, such as the real life
            CTF we had been planning. But it was still fairly lively as British
            LAN parties go, with plenty of alcohol, a variety of bizarre music
            pumping out through a pair of floor-standing speakers, and live DJs
            on the wheels of steel at times.
        </p>

  <p>
            The fragging went on well into the early hours of Sunday morning on
            the first day, and due to competitors and admins alike waking up
            late on the Sunday morning the remaining tournaments fell behind
            schedule a little, ending an hour later than planned. Hardly a
            major disaster though...
        </p>

  <p>
            Thanks to sponsorship from PC Gaming World, GameSpot UK, AMD and
            Videologic, the prizes included Athlon processors, motherboards,
            and a massive set of Sirocco speakers, as well as some rather funky
            AMD watches and a bundle of GameSpot t-shirts.
        </p>

  <p>
            There was even a special deal with Domino's pizzas to get half
            price food, and a steady stream of delivery men kept the gamers
            supplied with pizzas, chicken strippers (get your mind out of the
            gutter!) and Haagen Dazs ice cream throughout the weekend. Mmm...
            Chocolate.
        </p>

  <p>
            The Brighton event was just the first of a series of LAN parties
            though, so don't worry if you missed out - there should be an even
            bigger and better EuroLAN coming to a town near you soon!
